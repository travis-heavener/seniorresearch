- Move permissions stuff from Config.js to new PermissionsManager.js
  - Handle permission rejection
- Make data exporting/saving **better**
  - Encrypt data or something when saving to disk
- Advanced battery saver??
  - Control various settings for each battery-saver-controlled part
    - Ex. battery saver setting for geolocation, pedometer/devicemotion, etc.
- @expo-google-fonts?
- Add titles to user profile
  - ie. "Novice", "Amateur" (gets flagged on school WiFi lol), "Champion", "Olympian"
- Revisit card & objective random generation to improve performance (ie. generateEmptyPos method w/o a while loop)
  - Measure how long it takes to generate a card to see if more random iterations can be added
- Fix card generation w/ explore objectives
  - 4/19 daily card (#290573) generates two "Pond" objectives in bottom row at positions 3 & 5
    - There's no way it made it through all 50 or whatever random iterations that's crazy
      - Maybe do away with this or simply increase the iterations
  - Easy card #906016 and normal card #755129 have distance & step objectives in the same row/color
    - Maybe there's an error in the random generation algorithm
  - It's an issue with the preview build (not following the same logic as the development build???)
- Add debugLog & boolean value to Toolbox.js
  - Take argument about which file is printing to console (or obtain dynamically somehow)
