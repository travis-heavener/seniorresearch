  - react-navigation -> @react-navigation/native
  - react-navigation-stack -> @react-navigation/stack
- Update theme colors
  - Use CardDisplay theme for the CardSelectItem mini grid
- Potentially use GesterRecognizer from react-native-swipe-gestures to handle gesture recognition on the home screen
  - This can open each individual screen as the swipe gesture already dismisses them
  - Removes the need for tab navigator
- Make data exporting/saving **better**
  - Every time a setting changes
- Slow down sensor polling rates while profile modal is open????
  - You can literally see the compass moving around while the content itself is blurred
- Card display objective modals
  - For ALL objectives
    - Show progress for non-player completables
    - Confirm/reject for player completables
  - Pass both the confirmation and rejection functions to the modal
    - The modal itself can then call the functions to update the objective
    - This removes the need to use async functions in the generation of each TouchableOpacity
- Check that the bingo player-completed objectives are being set by the same random so that they're always the same with the seed
