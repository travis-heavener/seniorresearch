  - Control various settings for each battery-saver-controlled part
    - Ex. battery saver setting for geolocation, pedometer/devicemotion, etc.
- Add titles to user profile
  - ie. "Novice", "Amateur" (gets flagged on school WiFi lol), "Champion", "Olympian"
- Revisit card & objective random generation to improve performance (ie. generateEmptyPos method w/o a while loop)
  - Measure how long it takes to generate a card to see if more random iterations can be added
- Add debugLog & boolean value to Toolbox.js
  - Take argument about which file is printing to console (or obtain dynamically somehow)

- Keep screen from going to sleep during preview builds
- Move user level gold bubble thing to its own component
- Make an EventEmitter event to lockout the swipe navigation (ex. called by modals, TOS banner, etc.)
