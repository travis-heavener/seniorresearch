- Move permissions stuff from Config.js to new PermissionsManager.js
  - Handle permission rejection
- Make data exporting/saving **better**
  - Every time a setting changes
  - Encrypt data or something when saving to disk
- Advanced battery saver??
  - Control various settings for each battery-saver-controlled part
    - Ex. battery saver setting for geolocation, pedometer/devicemotion, etc.
- Fix formatting being based on raw pixel values
  - Use relative coords (ie. vw & vh)
    - borderWidth: 2 --> borderWidth: vw(0.1), for example
- @expo-google-fonts?
- Add titles to user profile
  - ie. "Novice", "Amateur" (gets flagged on school WiFi lol), "Champion", "Olympian"
- Add a separate file with an unlockable objective lookup
  - Ie. if one file needs to know if a theme is unlocked, the level at which it is unlocked
    should be stored with the objective in a RewardsManager.js file
